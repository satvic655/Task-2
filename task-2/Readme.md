Overview
This task involved analyzing a phishing email that pretended to be from Netflix.  
The goal was to identify red flags such as fake domains, mismatched links, and failed SPF/DKIM records.  
Through this exercise, I understood how phishing attempts use urgency, fear, and trust to trick users.
